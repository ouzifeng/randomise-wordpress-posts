# Bulk Change The Date For Wordpress Posts

A Wordpress plugin which will change the date of any Wordpress post from the current date to a random one up to 3 years ago.

## Functionality

This plugin will find all your current posts, then bulk change the published dates to a random date anytime from the current date up to 3 years ago. Once a post's date as been randomised, it will be ignored next time you run it to avoid changing it again

I randomises the dates 1 post every second, to reduce the risk of it server timeouts 

## Installation

Download the php and js file, zip them, then upload and install as you would any other plugin. The settings can be fonud in tools -> Randomize Dates
